![Pencil Sketch](insert_image_url_here)

Hello, Connections! ðŸŒŸ

I am excited to announce the successful completion of Task 3 for the Data Science Internship at Let's Grow More! ðŸŒ±

### Project Overview
In this project, I delved into the captivating realm of image processing using Python to transform ordinary images into captivating pencil sketches! ðŸŽ¨ The project involved the following key steps:

1. **Grayscale Magic:** Convert the image to a timeless black and white representation.
2. **Gaussian Textures:** Apply Gaussian blur to achieve an authentic sketch-like texture.
3. **Inversion Elegance:** Invert the grayscale image to enhance crucial details.
4. **Sketch Fusion:** Blend the grayscale image with the inverted blur, resulting in an artistic masterpiece.

### Code and Results
You can explore the complete Python code for this project on GitHub in Tejas_sketch directory
